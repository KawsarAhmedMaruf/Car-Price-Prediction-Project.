**Hello and welcome to my car price prediction project! My name is Kawsar Ahmed and I'm excited to present you with the details of this project.**

The main objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate machine learning model that can predict the price of a car based on various features. By employing ensemble techniques such as bagging and stacking, we aim to further improve the accuracy of our predictions.

Here is a comprehensive overview of the steps involved in this project:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - In this stage, we thoroughly examined and analyzed the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, explore their relationships, and identify any potential outliers.
   - To visualize the data, we employed various techniques such as `violin plot`, `stripplot`, `histograms`, `scatter plots`, `bar plots`, and `correlation matrices`. Moreover, `automated EDA` tools are also employed to swiftly extract insights from the dataset, enabling a quicker understanding of its nature and characteristics.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - Throughout the analysis, we discovered several key insights that can be useful for both car sellers and buyers.
   - For example, we found that most cars in the dataset predominantly use `petrol` and have `manual transmission`, indicating a common preference among buyers.
   - Furthermore, we observed that the majority of cars are sold by `dealers`, which suggests that selling through a dealer may result in higher prices compared to individual sellers.
   - Cars with no previous owners tend to fetch higher selling prices, highlighting the value of a `brand new` status. Additionally, it was observed that cars sold in `2018` have a higher selling price.
 
3. **Preprocessing:**
   - In this stage, we processed the data to ensure it is suitable for training our machine learning models.
   - Categorical variables were handled through label encoding, while numerical variables were checked for skewness and transformed using log transformations to achieve a more normal distribution.
   - Data normalization or scaling was also performed to ensure that all features are on a similar scale.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - To enhance the prediction accuracy, we conducted correlation analysis to identify the most important features in predicting car prices.
   - Additionally, we utilized the `SelectKBest` method to further refine the feature set and select the most relevant features for our models.

5. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
   - `Linear Regression` and several tree-based models, including `Decision Trees`, `Random Forests`, and `Gradient Boosting`, were trained and evaluated using `cross-validation`.
   - `Hyperparameter tuning` was performed to optimize the models and achieve the best performance.
   - Model evaluation metrics such as`R2 score`, `Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)`, `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)`, and `Mean Squared Error (MSE)` were calculated to assess the performance of each model.
   - Among these models, the highest achieved `R2 score` was an impressive `96%`.
   - To further enhance the prediction accuracy, we employed the stacking ensemble technique by combining the predictions of multiple models.

By following these steps, our car price prediction project aims to build a highly accurate and reliable machine learning model that can effectively estimate car prices based on the provided features.
